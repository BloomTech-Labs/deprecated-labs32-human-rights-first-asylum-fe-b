## What is working/not working as of labs30
1. Login is working well
2. Upload button is in place and styled but not talking to backend.
3. Collections element built and styled

## Accomplished in Labs30
1. Added styling using ant.design to whole site
2. Cleaned up some code
3. Connected the upload button to the main application and built enough that it does show an uploaded file in the model.

## Still needs to be done as of right now
1. Connect upload to backend
2. Connect collections to backend
